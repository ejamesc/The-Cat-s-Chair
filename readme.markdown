###How This Site Was Built

This site uses custom PHP code to validate and maintain character names. It lives on a server with a MySQL backend. Design is custom, but images are all taken from the Open Clipart archive.

I wrote this as my first CodeIgniter application -- almost as an excuse -- and I'm rather embarrassed by certain bits of it. (For instance - I _do_ realize that it's a little too much to use MySQL and a whole bloody framework for something as simple as this.)

###Narrative Concepts Explored

From the site's about page: this is a description of the goals of my assignment.

This project is an exercise in character. I have no control over the names each reader may choose to use for their reading of the story — or, indeed, should they choose not to set names of their own and read the story with names chosen by the reader before them.

This naturally makes it tricky for a reader to refer to the characters of the story — for instance, how might I talk of the protagonist if her name changes with every reading? How am I to talk about the Evil Cat (the antagonist in this piece) when his name changes according to the whims of a reader?

_The Cat's Chair_, written under the pseudonym Eli James in 2009, has been edited no less than five times, and once more in preparation for this project. It has an off-beat, quirky tone to it; something that I have attempted to maintain despite the change in medium.

My hope is that your reading of this narrative would be truly unique, small as these differences may be. For we do know that names do change our perception of character; _The Cat's Chair_ is written to be geographically neutral, and it doesn't take much imagination for the story to change, should one enterprising reader switch all the names to Russian!
