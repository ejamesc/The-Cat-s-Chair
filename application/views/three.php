<p id="bigger">The next morning found the cat at the exact same spot where we left him the night before. We ate breakfast in the family room, in full view of him, hoping to tempt him out of his throne.</p> 

<p>He watched us, but yawned and looked away, waving his tail irritably. It was as if he was saying: &quot;You can&#x27;t fool me. The chair&#x27;s still mine.&quot;</p>

<p>We gave up and went to school, with father driving and mother swearing revenge on the cursed animal - she sat in the front seat with the Yellow Pages in one hand and her Motorola in the other.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello? Is this the shelter? Yes, I&#x27;ve got a stray ca - what do you mean you&#x27;re full? Epidemic? Can&#x27;t you just &hellip; but we need &hellip; oh damn.&quot;</p>

<p>And it went on like that for the twenty minutes it took to reach school. Apparently some pet sickness - feline influenza or whatis - was making its rounds in the city and holding up every animal related organization within a 10 kilometre radius. Mum was dialing the number of the sixth vet when we reached school, and I left the car with a sliver of my mother&#x27;s frustration.</p>

<p>Cat: 2; Family: 0.</p>

<p>Now it didn&#x27;t help that Math was the first class of the day. &quot;Did you know there&#x27;s going to be a cat show at the Civic Centre next week?&quot; <?=$friend_name?> asked, looking up from her trigonometry.</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t talk to me about cats!&quot; I snapped back, mind still preoccupied with the domestic crisis. <?=$friend_name?> looked hurt, and I felt terrible. And so I forced myself to relate the whole story to her from beginning to end.</p>

<p>She chuckled when I finished. &quot;Mind if I follow you back home?&quot; she asked, later, when we had packed our books for the day and were heading out, &quot;It should prove interesting to try and get rid of him ...&quot; </p>

<p>When we got back, <?=$friend_name?> and my father and I were treated to high pitch yowling, punctuated with several human screams. It seemed like a badly written comedy: a man ran out of our front door, pants in shreds. Our gazes followed him down the driveway, out the gate and into a van - which promptly revved up and shot away.</p>

<p>Mum was at the doorway, &quot;And he was the only vet we could get hold of ...&quot; she sighed. &quot;<?=$my_name?>, get a broom and follow me in - we&#x27;ve got quite a mess on our hands.&quot;</p>

<p>She wasn&#x27;t kidding. After removing four cushions, broken pieces of porcelain and the ripped canvas of a painting (all the while under the benevolent gaze of the cat, who by now was cleaning his claws), I had to admit that we were worse off then we were the day before.</p>

<p>Cat: 3; Family: 0.</p>

<p>&quot;You know,&quot; <?=$friend_name?> said, as we cleared the room, &quot;You&#x27;re lucky most of these ornaments are second hand, otherwise your mum might&#x27;ve injured herself attacking the cat.&quot;</p>

<p><?=$friend_name?> was being blunt, but she wasn&#x27;t being rude. She knew that my parents loved visiting flea markets, where they could buy good furniture at very low prices. <?php echo($bro_name);?>&#x27;s chair, for example, cost a fourth of its original price.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the afternoon doing homework and only half-heartedly tried to lure the cat away - after seeing him in action with the vet we had no desire to rouse his anger. Our feeble attempts were met for the most part with the occasional flicked tail or a long fanged yawn.</p>

<p>After <?=$friend_name?> left the entire family ate dinner in the family room, though there was little hope of getting the cat to budge. It slept throughout our meal and we followed suit two hours later. We were all quite exhausted.</p>
